<p>Because I couldn't find the lyrics of this song anywhere, I typed it up myself. :P</p>
<p>Here's the song:<br />
<em>Edit: imeem is gone :(. Find the song on YouTube instead.</em></p>
<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<p>Come and look into my heart<br />
And you'll find me in your dreams<br />
And soon you'll be my gift of love<br />
It's just me and you<br />
Reaching through your every thought<br />
Is it always what it seems?<br />
But I will never leave your side<br />
It's just you and me</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<p>Look into your heart and let your body go crazy<br />
Get up here and dance because the rhythm's all baby<br />
Look into your heart and let your body go crazy<br />
Dance with me tonight<br />
(x2)<br />
If you dance in my heart<br />
I will love you forever<br />
Come and dance with me tonight<br />
If you dance, I will try<br />
To love you forever<br />
Won't you dance with me tonight?</p>
<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<p>Won't you reach into your soul<br />
Find out who you really are<br />
When you do I'll be your guide<br />
Make your dreams come true<br />
Follow me into a place<br />
Where we'll live forever more<br />
And I will never leave your sight<br />
It's just you and me</p>
<p>(repeat chorus)</p>
