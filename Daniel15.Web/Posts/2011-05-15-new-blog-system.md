<p>I was rewriting my site recently (to use the <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana framework</a> instead of WordPress), and I decided to write my own blog system at the same time. Finally, I've finished a basic version of it, and it's now live! This site is running on it, so hopefully there's no major issues! I do still love WordPress, but as a developer, it's often fun to create your own stuff (you know exactly what the code is doing, and it does exactly what you want). The code for this whole website is now <a href="https://github.com/Daniel15/Website">available on Github</a>, maybe some of you would find it interesting (especially if you're doing something similar yourself). Still a bit rough around the edges, but it's working fine. I've still got a bit I'd like to do with the blog (like improving the administration section). :)</p>

<p>My old blog used to have a "microblog" section where I'd occassionally post photos and stuff. I've moved all that onto a <a href="http://thoughts.dan.cx/">Tumblr</a> account, although now I'm thinking I should have used Posterous instead. Tumblr's uptime seems quite bad. I really don't understand why it's so popular... It seems like it's mainly the community rather than the site itself.</p>

<p>Eventually I might even post a proper blog article to here. Or to <a href="http://storyofarelationship.com/">my other blog with my girlfriend</a> :)</p>

<p>Until then,<br />
&mdash; Daniel</p>
