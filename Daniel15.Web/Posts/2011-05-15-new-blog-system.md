I was rewriting my site recently (to use the [Kohana framework](http://kohanaframework.org/) instead of WordPress), and I decided to write my own blog system at the same time. Finally, I've finished a basic version of it, and it's now live! This site is running on it, so hopefully there's no major issues! I do still love WordPress, but as a developer, it's often fun to create your own stuff (you know exactly what the code is doing, and it does exactly what you want). The code for this whole website is now [available on Github](https://github.com/Daniel15/Website), maybe some of you would find it interesting (especially if you're doing something similar yourself). Still a bit rough around the edges, but it's working fine. I've still got a bit I'd like to do with the blog (like improving the administration section). :)

My old blog used to have a "microblog" section where I'd occassionally post photos and stuff. I've moved all that onto a [Tumblr](http://thoughts.dan.cx/) account, although now I'm thinking I should have used Posterous instead. Tumblr's uptime seems quite bad. I really don't understand why it's so popular... It seems like it's mainly the community rather than the site itself.

Eventually I might even post a proper blog article to here. Or to [my other blog with my girlfriend](http://storyofarelationship.com/) :)

Until then,  

â€” Daniel
