Well, I did some minor changes to this blog today. Some of the main changes:

* Changed the theme from the default WordPress one to the nice [K2 theme](http://www.getk2.com/)
* Added several new plugins:
  * [Time Since](http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/time-since/) - Displays published dates like 'Published 1 week, 2 days ago'
  * [Browser Detection](http://priyadi.net/archives/2005/03/29/wordpress-browser-detection-plugin/) - Shows what browsers people use to post comments
  * [Extended Live Archive](http://www.sonsofskadi.net/extended-live-archive/)  - Adds a nice, AJAX-based 'Archives' page
* And yeah, that's about all :)
