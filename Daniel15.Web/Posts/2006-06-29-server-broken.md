<p>Well, I was working on my Linux testing server, and it stopped working for some reason... I tried to restart, but the computer wouldn't even boot (even from a CD). Upon unplugging all the IDE devices, and only leaving a CD drive in (a different one, in case it was faulty for whatever reason), it still wouldn't boot :(. I guess I won't be using that for a while...</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260000403990">buying a new server on eBay</a>, so it isn't that bad (all I need to do is wait for it to get shipped to me).</p>
<p>Old server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celeron 300 MHz</li>
<li>4.3GB Quantum Fireball lct and 4.3GB Seagate hard drives</li>
<li>48X CD-ROM drive</li>
<li>192MB membory</li>
</ul>
<p>New server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pentium III 650 MHz</li>
<li>8.4 GB hard drive</li>
<li>48X CD-ROM drive</li>
<li>256MB membory</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't say that it isn't that powerful... Linux makes <em>any computer</em> look powerful :D. Besides, it's only a server for testing stuff.</p>
<p>EDIT: Computer arrived today, 30th June 2006. That company on eBay was quick!</p>
