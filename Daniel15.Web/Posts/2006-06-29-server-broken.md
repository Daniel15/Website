Well, I was working on my Linux testing server, and it stopped working for some reason... I tried to restart, but the computer wouldn't even boot (even from a CD). Upon unplugging all the IDE devices, and only leaving a CD drive in (a different one, in case it was faulty for whatever reason), it still wouldn't boot :(. I guess I won't be using that for a while...

Anyways, I'm [buying a new server on eBay](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260000403990), so it isn't that bad (all I need to do is wait for it to get shipped to me).

Old server:

* Celeron 300 MHz
* 4.3GB Quantum Fireball lct and 4.3GB Seagate hard drives
* 48X CD-ROM drive
* 192MB membory

New server:

* Pentium III 650 MHz
* 8.4 GB hard drive
* 48X CD-ROM drive
* 256MB membory

Don't say that it isn't that powerful... Linux makes *any computer* look powerful :D. Besides, it's only a server for testing stuff.

EDIT: Computer arrived today, 30th June 2006. That company on eBay was quick!
