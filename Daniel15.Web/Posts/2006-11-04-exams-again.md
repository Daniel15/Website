Well, it's that time of year again: Exam time. Because of this, I won't have much time to work on my websites.  

Anyways, the exams I'm having are:

**Wednesday 8th November**

* 9:00am - 11:15am: English
* 1:40pm - 2:45pm: Maths Methods (non-calculator)

**Thursday 9th November**

* 11:05am - 12:40pm: Information Systems

**Friday 10th November**

* 11:05am - 1:10pm: Specialist Maths (calculator)

**Monday 13th November**

* 9:00am - 10:35am: Physics
* 1:40pm - 2:45pm: Specialist Maths (non-calculator)

**Tueaday 14th November**

* 9:00am - 10:35am: Chemistry
* 11:05am - 1:10pm: Maths Methods (calculator)

The best thing is that once all the exams are over, I don't have any more school :)
