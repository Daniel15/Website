<p>Well, my mid-year exams are now all done. I think that exams are the stupidest thing ever... Whoever invented them should be shot... in the foot :P</p>
<p>...erm... Yeah, anyway..... For our maths exams (Specialist Maths, and Maths Methods), we have a 2-hour exam where we can use a calculator, and a 1-hour calculator-free exam.</p>
<p>These are the exams I did:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>English</strong> - Bah, the English exam was stupid. We needed to write three essays in two hours! Having said that, I got a B on that exam (and I thought I was going to fail it :P)</li>
<li><strong>Physics</strong> - Physics was alright (I quite like Physics). The exam was actually just questions that were cut and pasted from various revision books! I got an A+ on this exam.</li>
<li><strong>Specialist Maths</strong> - This was hard, it involved maths stuff such as partial fractions, Circle theorems, and other stuff. If there's one maths area I hate, it's circle theorems! Having said that, I got an A+ on this exam</li>
<li><strong>Maths Methods</strong> - This was <em>easy</em>! Maths Methods is incredibly easy compared to Specialist Maths. I got 97% in the calculator-active test (the highest in the class). This involved stuff like quadratics, cubics, quartics, solving equasions, etc, etc. The overall mark was an A+</li>
<li><strong>Chemistry</strong> - This was the one exam I was dreading (I'm not really that good at chemistry). Nevertheless, I got a B on this exam (which I'm quite happy with)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah... That's all my exams...</p>
<p>In other news, someone recently spammed the CWH Networks forum:<br />

It took me the whole of 2 minutes to clean all that up. Seriously, when will these spammers learn? Geez! :D</p>
