<p>Saw this in a MySpace bulletin... And it's mostly so true. Except for 11 and 13, which I kinda disagree with :P<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>1. Guys are more emotional then you think, if they loved you at one point, it'll take them a lot longer then you think to let you go, and it hurts every second that they try.</p>
<p>2. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.</p>
<p>3. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.</p>
<p>4. Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.</p>
<p>5. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are method.</p>
<p>6. A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.</p>
<p>7. Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.</p>
<p>8. Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.</p>
<p>9. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...nevermind.." would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>10. Girls are guys' weaknesses.</p>
<p>11. Guys are very open about themselves.</p>
<p>12. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.</p>
<p>13. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.</p>
<p>14. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.</p>
<p>15. Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful.If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.</p>
<p>16. No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.</p>
<p>17. Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.</p>
<p>18. Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.</p>
<p>19. If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.</p>
<p>20. If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.</p>
<p>21. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.</p>
<p>22. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, "Please come and listen to me."</p>
<p>23. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.</p>
<p>24. When a guy tells you that you are beautiful, don't say you aren't. It makes them want to stop telling you because they don't want you to disagree with them.</p>
<p>25.When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.</p>
<p>26. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.</p>
<p>27. Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.</p>
<p>28. Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.</p>
<p>29. Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.</p>
<p>30. A guy would give his right nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.</p>
<p>31. No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.</p>
<p>32. Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.</p>
<p>33. They love it when girls talk about their boobs.</p>
<p>34. When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually</p>
<p>35. Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs.</p>
<p>36. Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts.</p>
<p>37. When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.</p>
