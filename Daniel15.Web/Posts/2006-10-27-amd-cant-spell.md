<p>I was looking through some status information on my web host, and I found out that doesn't have a processor. No, instead, it has a AMD Athlon(tm) <strong>Prosussor</strong>... How could something like this slip through AMD's <acronym title="Quality Assurance">QA</acronym>?<br />
Even funnier was a friend telling me that their server had an AMD Athlon(tm) <strong>Proswssor</strong> :P.</p>
