I was looking through some status information on my web host, and I found out that doesn't have a processor. No, instead, it has a AMD Athlon(tm) **Prosussor**... How could something like this slip through AMD's QA?  

Even funnier was a friend telling me that their server had an AMD Athlon(tm) **Proswssor** :P.

*[QA]: Quality Assurance
