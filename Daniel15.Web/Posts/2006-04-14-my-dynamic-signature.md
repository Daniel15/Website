Well, some people have been asking me about my signature image... In case you haven't seen it, here you go:

Nice, huh? :)  Seeing as I have no graphics skill whatsoever, I thought it would be nice to make something more technical.

I have a 'Hosted Signature' service, where someone can download my signature client, and have a signature similar to my one. If you ask me, I may give you a signature like this. Note that this is only for people that I know, I don't want random people asking me for signatures and stuff :P
