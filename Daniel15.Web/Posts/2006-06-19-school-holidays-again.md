<p>Well, it's the holidays again, so I'm back doing my <a href="http://www.daniel15.com/blog/2006/03/15/welcome/">ICT Fellowship</a>. I'm currently doing work in Microsoft Access, and also creating icons in a program called 'Easy Icon Maker'.</p>
<p>Speaking of Access, I encountered a weird error... I was drafting some Visual Basic code, and needed to look up something in the help file (as I was using Access, which I don't have much experience in). I got this error:<br />
<a href="http://img65.imageshack.us/my.php?image=62734msaccess13ke.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/2821/62734msaccess13ke.th.jpg" border="0" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I clicked the 'Help' button, and got this:<br />
<a href="http://img101.imageshack.us/my.php?image=62740msaccess23ye.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/7995/62740msaccess23ye.th.jpg" border="0" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us" /></a></p>
<p>A bug, maybe? After all, the help article opened in the 'Windows Help Application', yet the article was saying that the application wasn't installed! :P</p>
