<p>Well, I've just finished my ICT Fellowship. I must say, it was a great thing for me to do; it gave me something to do over the holidays :). I made some macros in Excel (which was not all that difficult, because I used to work with macros when I was younger)</p>
<p>Anyways, I did learn a few things... Some of the things I learnt were:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use Microsoft Access properly</li>
<li>That you can get images from Google Images and resize them to 32x32 to make good looking icons :D</li>
<li>The help in Microsoft Access's VBA doesn't function very well (see previous post)</li>
<li>How to use Microsoft Excel macros to do stuff like turn an ugly-looking worksheet to a nice one... The macro recorder is also quite handy</li>
</ul>
<p>It also gave me a good feel of what working in a workplace is like. Although I did have to spend 1 hour commuting every day, it was definately worth it :)</p>
<p>So, yeah... I'll be waiting for my cheque to arrive in the mail :D:D</p>
