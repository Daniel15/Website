Okay, so a lot of people read my [blog post about my MySpace account getting deleted for reporting a security issue](http://d15.biz/blog/2009/02/myspace-deleted-me-after-reporting-security-issue/). Well it appears someone named Joe from MySpace's *Security Enforcement* division read that post, and contacted me via email. He was able to restore my account, so I now have a working MySpace account again, and someone to report security issues to :)

So, yeah, things are all good now. Just thought I'd write a short post about this. :D
