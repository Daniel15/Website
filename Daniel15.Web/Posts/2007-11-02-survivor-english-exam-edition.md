<p>Around 46,000 students did their English exam today, me being one of them. The English exam sucks; I'm so bad at writing essays :( . It was alright, but I screwed up a bit of it. Basically, we have to write four essays &mdash; Two text response essays (essays based on texts we read in class), a language analysis piece (analyse the ways language is used in some articles), and a persuasive/opinionative piece. I spent too long on the analysis and persuasive pieces (as these are what I'm good at). I completed one of the text response essays and then noticed I only had like 25 minutes or so to do the last one. So it was horribly rushed and probably quite incoherent :P</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm soooo glad that exam is now over; it was the one exam I was really dreading. The exams I have left are:</p>
<p><strong>Monday 5th November</strong><br />
3:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM &mdash; Specialist Maths Exam 1 (non-calculator)</p>
<p><strong>Friday 9th November</strong><br />
9:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM &mdash; Maths Methods Exam 1 (non-calculator)</p>
<p><strong>Monday 12th November</strong><br />
11:45 AM&ndash;2:00 PM &mdash; Maths Methods Exam 2 (calculator)</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 14th November</strong><br />
11:45 AM&ndash;1:30 PM &mdash; Physics</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 15th November</strong><br />
9:00 AM&ndash;10:45 AM &mdash; Chemistry (ewwww :P )</p>
<p><strong>Friday 16th November</strong><br />
3:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM &mdash; Specialist Maths Exam 2 (calculator)</p>
<p>So yeah, after that, <strong style="font-size: x-large">No more school!</strong> On to University next year. I'm hoping that I get an ENTER score above 87, that way I'll get into Computer Science at Melbourne University :)</p>
<p><em>Edit: Some people were asking about the title of this post. It was referring to my MSN Messenger display name, which I had set to "<strong>It's Survivor: English Exam Edition. 46000 students, 4 hours, 3 essays. Who will survive?</strong>" for a while :D </em></p>
