Around 46,000 students did their English exam today, me being one of them. The English exam sucks; I'm so bad at writing essays :( . It was alright, but I screwed up a bit of it. Basically, we have to write four essays — Two text response essays (essays based on texts we read in class), a language analysis piece (analyse the ways language is used in some articles), and a persuasive/opinionative piece. I spent too long on the analysis and persuasive pieces (as these are what I'm good at). I completed one of the text response essays and then noticed I only had like 25 minutes or so to do the last one. So it was horribly rushed and probably quite incoherent :P

So yeah, I'm soooo glad that exam is now over; it was the one exam I was really dreading. The exams I have left are:

**Monday 5th November**  

3:00 PM–4:15 PM — Specialist Maths Exam 1 (non-calculator)

**Friday 9th November**  

9:00 AM–10:15 AM — Maths Methods Exam 1 (non-calculator)

**Monday 12th November**  

11:45 AM–2:00 PM — Maths Methods Exam 2 (calculator)

**Wednesday 14th November**  

11:45 AM–1:30 PM — Physics

**Thursday 15th November**  

9:00 AM–10:45 AM — Chemistry (ewwww :P )

**Friday 16th November**  

3:00 PM–5:15 PM — Specialist Maths Exam 2 (calculator)

So yeah, after that, **No more school!** On to University next year. I'm hoping that I get an ENTER score above 87, that way I'll get into Computer Science at Melbourne University :)

*Edit: Some people were asking about the title of this post. It was referring to my MSN Messenger display name, which I had set to "**It's Survivor: English Exam Edition. 46000 students, 4 hours, 3 essays. Who will survive?**" for a while :D *
