Today, I fixed the "transparency" issue on the Facebook Flash Embed application. Rather than using a transparent background for all Flash animations, it now allows you to set the background colour.  Some animations that did not display correctly previously will now appear correctly.

Additionally, a few minor bugs with the *Import a Flash "embed" code* were fixed as well. FlashVars in <embed> tags should now work properly.

As usual, please report any bugs to me :)
