<p>Today, I fixed the "transparency" issue on the Facebook Flash Embed application. Rather than using a transparent background for all Flash animations, it now allows you to set the background colour.  Some animations that did not display correctly previously will now appear correctly.</p>
<p>Additionally, a few minor bugs with the <i>Import a Flash "embed" code</i> were fixed as well. FlashVars in &lt;embed&gt; tags should now work properly.</p>
<p>As usual, please report any bugs to me :)</p>
