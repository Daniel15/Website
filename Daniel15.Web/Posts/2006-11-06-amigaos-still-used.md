Well, I was looking at last month's statistics for Daniel15.com, and I happened to notice something interesting in the list of browsers people are using:  

![Browsers used to visit site - October 2006](http://www.daniel15.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/stats-2.PNG)  

It appears that more of my site's visitors are now using Firefox rather than Internet Explorer... Also, 11% of visitors are Opera users (if only there were more :P)

What was even more interesting was the list of operating systems people are using:  

![Operating Systems used to visit site - October 2006](http://www.daniel15.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/stats-1.PNG)  

Can you see it? Look towards the end of that list... 10 hits from a person using AmigaOS! I didn't even know that AmigaOS was still used :P  

I had an Amiga 2000... A long, long time ago, before I knew how to use a computer properly. I always used this painting program (but I can no longer remember what it was called).  

**Update:** OK, I remember now, it was called DPaint :P
