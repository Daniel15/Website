<p>Well, I was looking at last month's statistics for Daniel15.com, and I happened to notice something interesting in the list of browsers people are using:<br />

It appears that more of my site's visitors are now using Firefox rather than Internet Explorer... Also, 11% of visitors are Opera users (if only there were more :P)</p>
<p>What was even more interesting was the list of operating systems people are using:<br />

Can you see it? Look towards the end of that list... 10 hits from a person using AmigaOS! I didn't even know that AmigaOS was still used :P<br />
I had an Amiga 2000... A long, long time ago, before I knew how to use a computer properly. I always used this painting program (but I can no longer remember what it was called).<br />
<strong>Update:</strong> OK, I remember now, it was called DPaint :P</p>
