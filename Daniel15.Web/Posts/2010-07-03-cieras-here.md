So, my girlfriend Ciera came back to Melbourne last Saturday (26th June 2010)! We've been having a **great** time so far, I'm so very glad to see her again! I honestly don't think I would have been able to wait much longer, so I'm extremely happy that she came her when she did. It's been a week since she got here, and things have already been so amazing! I think she's been enjoying it here heaps (I know she loves it in Australia), and I've certainly enjoyed it. Today we just did a bit of shopping, nothing too big. Bought a bookshelf to put all our books and stuff on :P

I can't wait for what the future is going to bring us!

Until next time,
