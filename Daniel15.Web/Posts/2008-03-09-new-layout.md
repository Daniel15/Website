Well, as you can see here, my blog has a new layout. The layout itself was written from scratch by me, although some parts of it were based off a [nice two-column CSS layout tutorial](http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/two-columns/index.htm) I found whilst searching in Google. This layout is not yet complete, I'm still working on it. What do you think so far? :)

The only problem now is my lack of blog posts. I haven't really had time to blog, but I'll definitely try to write some more posts here soonish :P
