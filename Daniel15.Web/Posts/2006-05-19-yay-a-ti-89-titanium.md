<p>Well, after bidding for 6 different TI-89 Titanium calculators on eBay, I finally got a TI-89 Titanium! I'm so happy now :D</p>
<p>I bought this one from my local <a href="http://www.cashconverters.com.au/">Cash Converters</a> :P.<br />
Man, I love this calculator :)<br />

<p>Now, I'm not sure what's shown in that picture of the calculator, but I suppose it doesn't matter. It still is a cool calculator 8)</p>
