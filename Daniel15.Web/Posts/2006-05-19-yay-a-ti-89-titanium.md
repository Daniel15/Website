Well, after bidding for 6 different TI-89 Titanium calculators on eBay, I finally got a TI-89 Titanium! I'm so happy now :D

I bought this one from my local [Cash Converters](http://www.cashconverters.com.au/) :P.  

Man, I love this calculator :)

Now, I'm not sure what's shown in that picture of the calculator, but I suppose it doesn't matter. It still is a cool calculator 8)
