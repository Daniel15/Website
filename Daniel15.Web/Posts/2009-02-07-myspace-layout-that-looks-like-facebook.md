Hey everyone,<br />
 I got bored today and thought it might be fun to make a MySpace profile layout that looks like Facebook. Considering I'm not a designer, I'm rather happy with how it turned out. There's a screenshot to the right, click on it to see a full-size version.  <!--One of the only minor problems I noticed is that the MySpace logo at the top-left is white, it doesn't look too good on the light background colour. Unfortunately, because of how MySpace put this on the page, I can't change the image. Also,--> I haven't tested in Internet Explorer, but that shouldn't be much of an issue, as most people are using better browsers... Right?</p>
<h3>Want to use it?</h3>
<p>Please feel free to use this layout on your profile. The only thing I ask is that you keep the credit (Layout by Daniel15) on the page, and in the CSS code itself.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do if you want to use this layout on your MySpace profile. You should probably already know how to use a MySpace Profile 2.0 layout, but here's a brief overview:</p>
<ol>
<li>This layout is a <strong>profile 2.0 layout</strong>. If you haven't already, you'll have to upgrade to MySpace Profile 2.0. This can be done by clicking the "<a href="http://profileedit.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pageeditor.profile"  target="_new">Customise Profile</a>" link in the "Profile" dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Go to the "<a href="http://profileedit.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pageeditor.profile"  target="_new">Customise Profile</a>" page.</li>
<li>Click "<em>Select Theme</em>" and choose the blank one.</li>
<li>Click "<em>Change Layout</em>" and choose a page width of 960px, and the layout with two columns.</li>
<li>Click "<em>CSS</em>" and paste <a href='http://d15.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/facebook.css'  target="_new">the CSS code</a> into the box.</li>
<li>Click "<em>Change Layout</em>" again (or any other option. You need to leave the CSS tab and go to another one for it to save the CSS settings).</li>
<li>Click "<em>Publish</em>"</li>
</ol>
<p><a href='http://d15.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/facebook.css'  target="_new">Here is the CSS (click)</a></p>
<p>If you don't like the header, and would prefer the default MySpace one, delete everything between <strong>{! Begin header - Remove this section if you want the normal MySpace header !}</strong> and <strong>{! End header !}</strong></p>
<p>Note I'm giving <strong>limited support</strong> for this layout. I can try to help you with bugs in the layout itself, but can't help you with anything beyond that. Having said that, please feel free to leave a comment if you find any issues with the layout.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br />
 &mdash; Daniel</p>
