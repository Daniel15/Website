I was recently searching for some Belkin stuff in Google, but accidentally mistyped Belkin as Belkikn. Strangely enough, Google's spell checker produced an interesting result:  

![Google - Belkin = D-Link](http://www.daniel15.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/google-belkin-dlink.PNG)

I guess Google likes D-Link more than Belkin? :P
