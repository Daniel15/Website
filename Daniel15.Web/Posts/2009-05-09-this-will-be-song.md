<p>Another song that I liked but couldn't find the lyrics to... Actually this one was from a mix, I've clipped it out and so I could have it as a separate MP3 file.</p>
<p>As for normal blogging, I'll resume eventually. Once I get university assignments and such sorted out, I guess.</p>
<p>Here's the song:<br />
<object width="200" height="175"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HXx9uVGPWCg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HXx9uVGPWCg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="200" height="175"></embed></object></p>
<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<p>Listen to me, and I will tell you,<br />
Of the way I like to live,<br />
Take each day as if it's my last,<br />
And every moment is my final breath<br />
I know it sounds as if I'm crazy,<br />
But I guess I will survive,<br />
And everyday I take a chance,<br />
Is another that I come alive</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<p>This will be (this will be)<br />
The best days of our lives<br />
This will be (this will be)<br />
Insanity run wild<br />
Follow me (follow me)<br />
To another level I have found<br />
And you shall find,<br />
we can reach for higher ground</p>
<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<p>Today is the first time I can feel that,<br />
This is where our journey starts<br />
And every mountain that we cross<br />
will be so different than the last<br />
And just believe me when I tell you,<br />
Every step that we will take<br />
To the next illusive place<br />
It's gonna take your breath away</p>
<p>(repeat chorus)</p>
