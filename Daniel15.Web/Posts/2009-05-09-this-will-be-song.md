Another song that I liked but couldn't find the lyrics to... Actually this one was from a mix, I've clipped it out and so I could have it as a separate MP3 file.

As for normal blogging, I'll resume eventually. Once I get university assignments and such sorted out, I guess.

Here's the song:

## [Verse 1]
Listen to me, and I will tell you,  

Of the way I like to live,  

Take each day as if it's my last,  

And every moment is my final breath  

I know it sounds as if I'm crazy,  

But I guess I will survive,  

And everyday I take a chance,  

Is another that I come alive

<!--more-->

## [Chorus]
This will be (this will be)  

The best days of our lives  

This will be (this will be)  

Insanity run wild  

Follow me (follow me)  

To another level I have found  

And you shall find,  

we can reach for higher ground

## [Verse 2]
Today is the first time I can feel that,  

This is where our journey starts  

And every mountain that we cross  

will be so different than the last  

And just believe me when I tell you,  

Every step that we will take  

To the next illusive place  

It's gonna take your breath away

(repeat chorus)
