<p>So I thought I'd finally write a little blog post about a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DBZNappa">Twitter bot</a> I made a while ago. A few people emailed me asking for the source code, so I had previously <a href="http://webdevrefinery.com/forums/topic/5039-ideas-for-a-twitter-bot/page__view__findpost__p__42777">posted about it on webDevRefinery</a>, but never on my own blog. Basically all the bot does is search for whenever people mention "<a href="http://ohinternet.com/Over_9000" rel="nofollow">over 9000</a>" or "over nine thousand", and replies with "WHAT, NINE THOUSAND?!". Pretty simple, but I wanted to learn about using the Twitter API. It seems to have inspired the creation of other Twitter bots, like <a href="http://davidcurado.com.br/projects/annoyingnavi/">AnnoyingNavi</a> and <a href="http://aqua3.bplaced.net/2011/06/the-spacesphere/">The Spacesphere</a>, which I think is pretty cool. :).</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/820281">available as a Gist on Github</a>. It is written in PHP and requires the PECL OAuth extension to be installed. I think it's a pretty good example of a simple "search and reply" Twitter bot, that could easily be extended to do more useful things.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br />
&mdash; Daniel</p>
