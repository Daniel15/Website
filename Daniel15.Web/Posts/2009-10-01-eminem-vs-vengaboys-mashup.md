<p>Well, I got bored, so I decided to create a mashup of <em>We Like to Party</em> by the Vengaboys, and <em>Without Me</em> by Eminem. This is the first mashup I've ever done, so it's probably not too good :P<br />
Have a listen here:<br />

<p>Tell me what you think :)</p>
<p>I'll eventually post a proper blog post, I've been pretty busy. Ciera came here for three months (gotta blog post about that, of course :D), and I've had quite a lot of university work as well.</p>
