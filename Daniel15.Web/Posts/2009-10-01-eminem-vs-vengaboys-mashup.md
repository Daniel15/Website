Well, I got bored, so I decided to create a mashup of *We Like to Party* by the Vengaboys, and *Without Me* by Eminem. This is the first mashup I've ever done, so it's probably not too good :P  

Have a listen here:

Tell me what you think :)

I'll eventually post a proper blog post, I've been pretty busy. Ciera came here for three months (gotta blog post about that, of course :D), and I've had quite a lot of university work as well.
