<p>The next major version of SMF, SMF 2.0, has been <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=163438">announced on the Simple Machines Community Forum</a>. This new version is a significant step forward from SMF 1.1, and has been in development alongside it since December 2005.</p>
<p>Some of the features annouced so far include (quoted from the post linked above):</p>
<ul>
<li>Database abstraction - with support for PostgreSQL and SQLite planned alongside that of MySQL.
</li>
<li>Automatic installation of packages into themes other than just the default.
</li>
<li>Email templates to simplify customization of forum emails.
</li>
<li>Moderation center including post, topic and attachment moderation - to allow approving of user content before it is made public.
</li>
<li>User warning system.
</li>
<li>Additional group functionally including group moderators and requestable/free assignable groups.
</li>
<li>WYSIWYG editor to provide an intuitive user interface to those users not familiar with BBC.
</li>
<li>Permission improvements such as group inheritance and permission profiles to further reduce the complexity of the permissions system.
</li>
<li>File based caching for a performance increase on all forums regardless of whether an accelerator is installed.
</li>
<li>Mail queuing system to stagger the sending of emails to improve performance on large forums.
</li>
<li>Advanced signature settings to allow the administrator of a forum to more tightly control the contents of users signatures.
</li>
<li>Personal messaging improvements including ability to automatically sort incoming messages and a variety of display options.
</li>
<li>Improved upgrade script with better timeout protection and simpler user interface.
</li>
<li>Custom profile fields to enable administrators to add additional member fields from the administration center.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is going to be awesome. I've been trying out a few alpha versions of it, and it looks amazing. Note that it will still be a while before a public beta, as there's still some bugs to work out.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work, guys! :D</p>
