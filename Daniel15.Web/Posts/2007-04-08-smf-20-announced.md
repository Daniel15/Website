The next major version of SMF, SMF 2.0, has been [announced on the Simple Machines Community Forum](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=163438). This new version is a significant step forward from SMF 1.1, and has been in development alongside it since December 2005.

Some of the features annouced so far include (quoted from the post linked above):

* Database abstraction - with support for PostgreSQL and SQLite planned alongside that of MySQL.

* Automatic installation of packages into themes other than just the default.

* Email templates to simplify customization of forum emails.

* Moderation center including post, topic and attachment moderation - to allow approving of user content before it is made public.

* User warning system.

* Additional group functionally including group moderators and requestable/free assignable groups.

* WYSIWYG editor to provide an intuitive user interface to those users not familiar with BBC.

* Permission improvements such as group inheritance and permission profiles to further reduce the complexity of the permissions system.

* File based caching for a performance increase on all forums regardless of whether an accelerator is installed.

* Mail queuing system to stagger the sending of emails to improve performance on large forums.

* Advanced signature settings to allow the administrator of a forum to more tightly control the contents of users signatures.

* Personal messaging improvements including ability to automatically sort incoming messages and a variety of display options.

* Improved upgrade script with better timeout protection and simpler user interface.

* Custom profile fields to enable administrators to add additional member fields from the administration center.

This release is going to be awesome. I've been trying out a few alpha versions of it, and it looks amazing. Note that it will still be a while before a public beta, as there's still some bugs to work out.

Keep up the great work, guys! :D
