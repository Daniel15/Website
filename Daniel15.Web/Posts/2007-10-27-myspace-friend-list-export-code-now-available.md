<p>The code for the <a href="http://www.daniel15.com/blog/2007/09/19/myspace-friend-list-export/">MySpace Friend List Export</a> script I wrote a while back is now available for download. If you're a PHP programmer and are interested in viewing the source code for it, take a look at <a href="http://stuff.daniel15.com/php/myspace/get_friends.txt">http://stuff.daniel15.com/php/myspace/get_friends.txt</a> :)</p>
<p>The code is quite ugly, but, well, so is MySpace. That's my excuse. :P</p>
