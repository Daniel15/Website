The code for the [MySpace Friend List Export](http://www.daniel15.com/blog/2007/09/19/myspace-friend-list-export/) script I wrote a while back is now available for download. If you're a PHP programmer and are interested in viewing the source code for it, take a look at http://stuff.daniel15.com/php/myspace/get_friends.txt :)

The code is quite ugly, but, well, so is MySpace. That's my excuse. :P
